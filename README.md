# SpringOne Platform 2018 - Spinnaker and the Distributed Monorepo

## Introduction

This repository contains the speaker deck plus instructions for replicating the
entire experiment featured in Jon's talk on distributed refactoring with Netflix Rewrite.

The following instructions help you run the Rewrite rule we created in `rewrite-guava` at
cloud scale on Google Cloud Dataproc against Google's latest snapshot of Github sources.

The experiment can be run for less than $20 on Google Cloud Dataproc, so runs easily with the $300 credits Google provides on its free tier.

The speaker deck is located at `deck/presentation.pdf`.

## BigQuery

I've created a project in my Google Cloud account.
Substitute your own project name for `myproject` in the queries below.

### Step 1: Identify all Java sources

In options, save the results of this query to: `myproject:springone.java_files`.
You will have to allow large results as well. This is a fairly cheap query (336 GB).

```sql
SELECT * FROM [bigquery-public-data:github_repos.files]
WHERE RIGHT(path, 5) = '.java'
```

### Step 2: Move Java source file contents

This will blow past the monthly free tier and eat into your $300 credits.
It cost me approximately $6 (1.94 TB) when I ran it on May 31.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM [bigquery-public-data:github_repos.contents]
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM [myproject:springone.java_files])
```

Save the results of this query to: `myproject:springone.java_file_contents`.
Again, allow large results as well.

### Step 3: Identify Guava related sources

Things start getting cheaper now because we are dealing with smaller and smaller datasets
(95.6 GB).

```sql
SELECT repo_name, path, content FROM [myproject:springone.java_file_contents] contents
INNER JOIN [myproject:springone.java_files] files ON files.id = contents.id
WHERE content CONTAINS 'import com.google.common'
```

Notice we are going to join just enough data from `springone.java_files`
and `springone:java_file_contents` in order to be able to construct our PRs.

Save the result to `myproject:springone.java_file_contents_guava`.

Through Step 3, we have cut down the size of the initial BigQuery public dataset
from 1.94 TB to around 25 GB. Much more manageable!

Also, I promise, this is the last simple text searching we will need to do!

There were 2,683,053 Java sources referring to Guava on May 31, 2017!

### Step 4: Creating a Dataproc Cluster:

#### From the command line

`gcloud dataproc clusters create cluster-1 \
  --initialization-actions gs://dataproc-initialization-actions/zeppelin/zeppelin.sh,gs://springone-2018-rewrite/atlas-dataproc-init.sh \
  -z us-central1-a \
  --master-boot-disk-size=100GB \
  --worker-boot-disk-size=100GB`

#### Through the console UI

Create a new Dataproc cluster (the default `cluster-1` name is fine), with a 4 core master, and 2 nodes (4 cores each). In advanced settings, install the initializers:

1) `gs://dataproc-initialization-actions/zeppelin/zeppelin.sh`
2) `gs://springone-2018-rewrite/atlas-dataproc-init.sh`

You can reduce the disk size of both the master and workers to 100GB.

### Step 5: Establish a SOCKS5 proxy and configure the Spark interpreter

Follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/cluster-web-interfaces) to set up a socks5 SSH tunnel:

1) `gcloud compute ssh --ssh-flag="-D 1080" --ssh-flag="-N" --ssh-flag="-n" cluster-1-m`
2) `/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:1080" --host-resolver-rules="MAP * 0.0.0.0 , EXCLUDE localhost" --user-data-dir=/tmp/` (can be left open even when the SSH tunnel is closed)

Through the socks5-enabled browser:
1) `localhost:8080` to access Zeppelin.
2) `localhost:4040` to access Spark UI
3) `localhost:7101` is where Atlas is running.

On the Spark interpreter configuration, set `spark.executor.memory` to 4g. Otherwise,
memory pressure starts to build up on parsing, slowing it down substantially.

### Step 6: Run the fixit job!

Import the Guava notebook from `zeppelin/Guava.json`. You should change the project name
in the two paragraphs that interact with BigQuery.

Run it!

### Appendix A. Metrics

Some paragraphs of the Zeppelin notebook define RDD transformations that ship timings to Atlas running on the master.

#### Parsing

Here is the query to monitor the AST parsing stage. This should be run in your browser
window that is connected to the SOCKS5 proxy.

http://localhost:7101/api/v1/graph?q=name,parse,:eq,statistic,count,:eq,:and,source+file+count,:legend,1,:axis,name,parse,:eq,statistic,totalTime,:eq,:and,name,parse,:eq,statistic,count,:eq,:and,:div,average+latency,:legend,2,:lw&tz=US/Central&l=0&title=Rewrite+Source+Parsing&ylabel.0=seconds&ylabel.1=sources/second&s=e-20m

```http

       q=
       name,parse,:eq,statistic,count,:eq,:and,
        source+file+count,:legend,
        1,:axis,
      name,parse,:eq,statistic,totalTime,:eq,:and,
        name,parse,:eq,statistic,count,:eq,:and,

        average+latency,:legend,

      &tz=US/Central
      &l=0
      &title=Rewrite+Source+Parsing
      &ylabel.0=seconds
      &ylabel.1=sources/second
      &s=e-20m
Host: localhost:7101
```

### Appendix B. Results

The last paragraph of the Zeppelin notebook creates a BigQuery table with the diffs
required to patch affected repos.
